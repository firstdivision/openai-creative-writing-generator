"A dusty, hand-painted fresco in the foyer of your friend's crumbling castle village seems to seep with secrets as the annual Harvest Ball nears. When you stumble upon an old pocket watch buried within its borders, hours – years – slip away like spilled ink on wet stone: 3pm turns to midnight under whispered laughter in a crowded garden; morning sun paints frost on windowsills; then it strikes again, leaving you with only fading echoes of memories lived by those already long deceased.

"The town's mourning choir gathers weekly at the dilapidated manor, yet only half their hymns refer to the loss of her son; its walls display the faint bruises of paint that once displayed an exact photograph of each mourner – though in one room, a single chair remains with no occupant and only dust-covered photographs remain of the children who died within these walls; your protagonist must choose between confirming what lies are required for their town to heal or face losing another precious color from the life they now cherish"
